# <img alt="Eclipse Apoapsis Guidace" src="website/static/img/logo.svg" width="10%"> Eclipse Apoapsis - Guidance
The guidance for the Open Source Component Management process consists of a generic architecture description, usage blueprints, a concept of the abstraction layer and a collection of use cases. It enables you to quickly match your organization's needs with available solutions and jump-start your process definition by providing templates.

# Scope
This guidance focusses on downstream usage of Software (Open Source Software) components e.g. starting as an idea in the Open Source Community and ending at the end user.
(For contribution aspects please refer to the ToDo-Guide for outbound open source)
