# Problem Space

As a [Compliance Manager](https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value/blob/master/User-Stories/Compliance-Manager-User-Stories/ComplianceManager.md) I want to have a Product Dashboard so that I can continuously monitor the compliance status.

As a [Security Manager] I want to have a [Product Dashboard](../blueprints/ProductDashboard.md) so that I can continuously monitor the security status.

Please contribute
