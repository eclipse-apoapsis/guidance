# Problem Space

As a [Software Development Team](https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value/blob/master/User-Stories/Software-Developer-User-Stories/Software-Developer-Epic.md) I want a [continuous development monitoring](../blueprints/ContinuousDevelopmentMonitoring.md) so that I get fast feedback about the status of non-functional requirements in my project.
