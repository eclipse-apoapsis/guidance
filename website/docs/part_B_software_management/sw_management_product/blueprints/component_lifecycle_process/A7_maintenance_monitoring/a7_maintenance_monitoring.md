# A7 Maintenance Monitoring

The Maintenance Monitoring is a process to ensure that the criteria of the [Distribution Check](../A6_distribution_check_and_quality_gate/a6_distribution_check_and_quality_gate.md) are still met after distribution according to the information currently available.

The reports from the Development Monitoring may be used to track vulnerabilities in the dependencies after making the software available.

## OSM Bi-diretional traceability

As a special case of Maintenance Monitoring, there might be external Open Source inquiries that need to be handled.

In order to effectively respond to such inquiries, the A8 Open Source Meta Database may be consulted to track the concerned Software product or Open Source component.
